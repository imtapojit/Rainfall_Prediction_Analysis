# 🌧️ Rainfall Prediction Analysis : *A Machine Learning Approach to Forecast Rainfall Using Meteorological Data*

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Rainfall Prediction Analysis is a machine learning project designed to forecast rainfall in a specific region based on historical meteorological data. By utilizing a range of climatic and environmental features, this project aims to uncover underlying patterns and train predictive models that enable more accurate and timely weather forecasts.

This project serves as an excellent application of ML techniques in environmental analytics, providing insights into how data science can contribute to climate resilience and disaster preparedness.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Predict the likelihood or amount of rainfall in a given region.
- Analyze the influence of environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, pressure, wind speed, and cloud cover.
- Evaluate different machine learning algorithms for performance comparison.
- Build a robust, generalizable model for future prediction tasks.

## 📊 Dataset Overview

The dataset used contains historical weather records including features like:

- Temperature  
- Humidity  
- Pressure  
- Wind Speed  
- Cloud Cover  
- Rainfall Amount (Target Variable)

✅ Data was preprocessed to handle missing values, standardize units, and encode categorical variables where necessary.

## 🔍 Feature Engineering

- Generated lag variables for temporal trend modeling  
- Scaled continuous variables using MinMaxScaler  
- Created binary rainfall indicators (Yes/No)  
- Converted dates into cyclical features (day/month)

## 🧠 Models Used

The following machine learning algorithms were explored and compared:

- *Linear Regression*
- *Logistic Regression*
- *Decision Tree*
- *Random Forest*
- *XGBoost*
- *Support Vector Machine (SVM)*
- *K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)*

The best-performing models were selected based on precision, recall, F1-score, RMSE, and R² metrics.

## ⚙️ Workflow

1. *Data Collection*  
   Acquired historical weather data from public meteorological repositories.

2. *Preprocessing*  
   Cleaned, imputed, and transformed the dataset to make it ML-ready.

3. *Feature Engineering*  
   Extracted new variables and reduced dimensionality where necessary.

4. *Model Training & Evaluation*  
   Split data into training/testing sets and evaluated models using cross-validation.

5. *Hyperparameter Tuning*  
   Used grid search and random search to fine-tune model performance.
